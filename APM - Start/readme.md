1) Open a command prompt in the project's root directory (APM)

2) Type: `npm install`
    This installs the dependencies as defined in the package.json file.
    
3) Type: `npm start`
    This launches the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile the application and wait for changes. 
    It also starts the lite-server and launches the browser to run the application.



NOTE: This is installed to localhost/Angular2Demo/, which is configured in the `<base>` tag in index.html and in the `<url-rewrite>` rule in the web.config file.
